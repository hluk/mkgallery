mkgallery python script
=======================
usage: ./mkgallery.py [options] [directories|filenames]

    Creates HTML gallery containing images and fonts recursively
    found in given directories and files or in the current directory.

    If BROWSER environment variable is set, the gallery is
    automatically viewed using web browser $BROWSER.

    For the program to be able to generate thumbnails and font names,
    you must have Python Imaging Library (PIL) is installed.

options:
    -h, --help              prints this help
    -t, --title=<title>     gallery title
                              (default: 'default')
    -d, --directory=<dir>   path to gallery (%s is replaced by <title>)
                              (default: '300')
    --template=<dir>        path to template html and support files
                              (default: './galleries/%s')
    -u, --url=<url>         url location for web browser (%s is replaced by <title>)
                              (default: 'file:///<path_to_gallery>/index.html')
    -r, --resolution=<res>  resolution for thumbnails in pixels
                              (default: .)
    -c, --copy              copy files instead of creating symbolic links
	-f, --force             overwrites existing gallery

    -r 0, --resolution=0    don't generate thumbnails
    -u "", --url=""         don't launch web browser


Creating gallery manually
=========================
To create new gallery (without using the python script) just copy images,
fonts, audio and video files to subdirectory "items" and edit files "items.js"
and "fonts.js" (see next sections).

The default HTML file ("template.html") can be modified so that gallery doesn't
contain list of items, navigation elements, information label, help or even
viewer.

Specific options can be modified in file "config.js" or overridden in URL hash
(the part after hash sign, e.g.
".../index.html#preload_images=5&zoom_step=0.25").

The gallery appearance can be changed in default CSS files in directory
"files". The gallery elements like viewer, information bar, item list, help or
navigation can be modified or completely removed from HTML file. For further
information see the default commented HTML file "template.html".

Directory "thumbs" contains thumbnails of images in gallery (thumbnail have same filename as the image).

Default directory structure is:
    /:
        index.html
        config.js
        fonts.css
        items.js

    /files:
        bg.png
        bg2.png
        bg3.png
        favicon.png
        gallery.js
        style.css
        style-list-print.css
        style-list-simple.css
        style-print.css

    /items:
        ...
    /thumbs:
        ...


items.js
--------
In this file create array "ls". Each entry of the array can be either string
--- relative path of a file in directory "items" --- or an array containing
two entries:
	- item path,
	- item properties,
and two optional entries representing thumbnail width and height. Even though
these two entries are optional you shoud set them because the thumbnails are
dynamically loaded into item list when the list is viewed for the first time.

The item properties are used to set contents of HTML elements. For example:
	{alias:"Nice photo", description:"This is my <b>favorite</b>!"}
sets contents of elements with classes "alias" and "description".

For example file "items.js" for gallery with five PNG images contains:
    var ls = [
        ["face-smile-big.png", {alias:"Smile!"}, 256, 256],
        ["face-tired.png", {}, 256, 256],
         "stock_smiley-5.png",
        ["face-uncertain.png", {alias:"Uncertain smiley"}],
         "face-angel.png",
    ];
    var title = "Smileys";

The variables "title" is optional (title of gallery; default value is "default").


fonts.css
---------
This file contains font definitions.
For example:
    @font-face{font-family:fonts_LinLibertine_Re_otf;src:url('items/fonts/LinLibertine_Re.otf');}

The font name must be same as path to the font relative to "items" directory
with all characters that are not a letter, a digit or space replaced with underscore.
